Colisseum app - basic version.

1.I've changed the rule for defining chance of attack: now its CurrentDEX (BaseDEX *LVL) as % of chance of attack (testing purposes).
2.ListNames as private field in Gladiator class  = I'm not convinced that it's efficient, as the entire list has to be created
    every time I make an instance of Gladiator, but I was told by one of the mentors, while checking Car Race assignment, that was the way.
    Initially, I would have put it in Tournament class, to create that list just once per tournament.
3.No additional features implemented (yet?) - I quite know how to implement all of them. They won't change the app structure anyway, and that's what
  was the most important for me to get right.
4. Method getGladiatorType in Gladiator subclasses - I know there's a getClass method, not using it was just easier as I didn't have to get rid of the word in
   return product"class".
